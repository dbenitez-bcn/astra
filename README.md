Astra: the memories keeper

## Description

When you keep a memory, it turns into a star and when more memories you keep, more large is your universe.


## Getting Started

This project is for the Flutter Create contest.

To keep a memory tap on the add button. Then, fill the title and the description. Finally, take a picture about the memory you want to keep. Magically a new star will appear in your universe! To relive a memory, just pick a star and you will see it again.
